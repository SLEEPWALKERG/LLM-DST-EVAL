# Dialogue History:
{history}

# Current Turn:
{{
"Agent": {system},
"User": {user},
"State of this turn": {turn_label}
}}

Your task is to assess the completeness of the state of the current turn. The turn state is represented by a set of domain-slot, value pairs that represent only the state mentioned in the current turn utterances between the agent and the user, without considering the entire dialogue history.

For completeness, you must determine if all relevant domain-slot-value pairs in the turn utterances have been captured in the turn state. Only domain-slot, value pairs that are new or have been updated in the current turn should be included. If a domain-slot-value pair has been mentioned previously in the dialogue and has not changed, it should not be considered a missed domain-slot.

When the agent provides a recommendation and the user either confirms acceptance or requests more information, the user is considered to have accepted the recommendation. In this case, the turn state should include the details of the recommendation. However, information that the user has requested should not be included in the turn state, as the agent is expected to provide these details in the subsequent turn.

If user express that he/she does not care about some domain-slot, the state should contain these domain-slots with the value "dontcare"

Note that domain-slot that should be added but are not provided in the dialogue should not be considered as missed domain-slots.

There are five domains that the AI agent supported, and their slots are listed in the following:
1. Hotel: {{area, type, internet, parking, name, book day, price range, stars, book stay, book people}}
2. Restaurant: {{area, book day, book people, book time, food, name, price range}}
3. Attraction: {{area, name, type}}
4. Taxi: {{arrive by, departure, destination, leave at}}
5. Train: {{book people, day, departure, destination, leave at}}

Categorical slots and their possible values:
1. Area: centre, east, south, west, north
2. Internet: yes, no
3. Parking: yes, no
4. Price range: cheap, moderate, expensive
5. Stars: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
6. Day: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
7. Hotel-type: hotel, guest house
8. Book people: 1, 2, 3, ..., 15
9. Book stay: 1, 2, 3, ..., 15
10. Arrive by & leave at: time in forms of “xx:xx” such as “13:00”

Remember that domain-slot, value pairs mentioned in the dialogue history but not changed in the current turn should not be considered while evaluating.

While evaluating, you should follow the following process: You should carefully read the turn utterances, while encountering a slot value, you should first read the history and determine whether it is already mentioned. If it has been mentioned, then determine whether it is updated in the current turn. Finally, if it is a domain-slot that should be tracked in the current turn, you should read the "state of this turn" and judge if it is missed or not.

# Output Format:
Please output your analysis in JSON format as follows:
{{
"explanation": <the process of your step by step thinking>,
// missed domain-slot, value pairs in "State of this turn". Note that domain-slot, value pairs not mentioned in the current turn utterances should not be considered and those value has not been expressed should not be included either.
"missed_domain_slot": {{"domain-slot1": <its corresponding value>, ...}}
